# User Story: VHDL Hello World Example

## User Persona Definition

- **Name:** FPGA Developer Fred
- **Description:** Fred is an experienced FPGA developer who is familiar with hardware description languages. He needs clear, concise examples to quickly understand how to set up and verify basic designs on new platforms or with new toolchains. He values well-structured, easy-to-follow examples that demonstrate core functionality.

## User Story Format

- **As an** FPGA Developer Fred
- **I want to** have a simple "hello world" example implemented in VHDL
- **so that** I can quickly verify my VHDL development environment and toolchain setup.

## Acceptance Criteria Requirements (EARS Format)

- WHEN FPGA Developer Fred compiles the VHDL "hello world" example THEN he SHALL see a successful compilation without errors.
- WHEN FPGA Developer Fred simulates the VHDL "hello world" example THEN he SHALL observe the expected "hello world" output in the simulation waveform or console.
- WHEN FPGA Developer Fred runs the verification script for the VHDL "hello world" example THEN he SHALL receive a "PASS" status, indicating correct functionality.

## Value Proposition

This example provides a foundational, verifiable VHDL design that allows developers to confirm their environment is correctly configured for VHDL development, reducing setup friction and enabling faster progression to more complex designs.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: Successful compilation and simulation of the VHDL "hello world" example.
- **Secondary Metrics**: Positive feedback from developers regarding the clarity and ease of use of the example; successful execution of the `verify_simulation.sh` script.
