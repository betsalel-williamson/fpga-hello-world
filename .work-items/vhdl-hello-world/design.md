# Design: VHDL Hello World Example

## 1. Objective

To provide a simple, verifiable "hello world" example implemented in VHDL to allow FPGA developers to quickly confirm their VHDL development environment and toolchain setup.

## 2. Technical Design

The VHDL "hello world" example will consist of a basic VHDL entity and architecture that outputs a simple message or toggles an LED-like signal. The design will be accompanied by a `Makefile` for compilation and simulation using a standard VHDL simulator (e.g., GHDL, ModelSim/QuestaSim). A `verify_simulation.sh` script will automate the simulation and check for expected output, similar to the existing SystemVerilog example. The structure will be:

- `src/vhdl/hello_world/hello_world.vhd`: The main VHDL source file.
- `src/vhdl/hello_world/Makefile`: For compiling and simulating the VHDL code.
- `src/vhdl/hello_world/verify_simulation.sh`: A script to run the simulation and verify its output.
- `src/vhdl/hello_world/.gitignore`: To ignore simulation output files.

This design aligns with the project's goal of providing clear, self-contained examples for different HDL languages.

## 3. Key Changes

### 3.1. API Contracts

N/A - This is a hardware design example, not an API.

### 3.2. Data Models

N/A - This is a hardware design example, not a data model.

### 3.3. Component Responsibilities

- `hello_world.vhd`: Defines a simple VHDL entity and architecture. For instance, it could have a clock input and an output signal that toggles or a simple counter that drives an output.
- `Makefile`: Manages the compilation of `hello_world.vhd` and the execution of the simulation. It will define targets for `all`, `clean`, and `simulate`.
- `verify_simulation.sh`: Executes the simulation via the `Makefile` and then checks the simulation output (e.g., a VCD file or console output) for the expected behavior. It will report "PASS" or "FAIL".

## 4. Alternatives Considered

- **Using a more complex VHDL example**: Rejected because the objective is a simple "hello world" for environment verification, not a feature demonstration. Simplicity aids quick setup confirmation.
- **Manual compilation/simulation instructions**: Rejected in favor of a `Makefile` and `verify_simulation.sh` for automation, consistency, and ease of use, mirroring existing project conventions.

## 5. Out of Scope

- Synthesis for a specific FPGA target.
- Advanced VHDL features or complex design patterns.
- Integration with a larger system.
- Detailed timing analysis or formal verification.
