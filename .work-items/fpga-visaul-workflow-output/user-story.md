### User Story: Automated Visual Workflow Output Examination

#### User Persona Definition
- **Name:** FPGA Developer
- **Description:** An FPGA developer is a software engineer specializing in FPGA development. This role is responsible for designing, simulating, and verifying Verilog code. The developer needs efficient ways to quickly assess the correctness of designs, especially when working in automated CI/CD environments where visual inspection is not always feasible.

**As an FPGA Developer,**
**I want to easily examine visual outputs (like waveform diagrams) from the FPGA workflow in an automated fashion,**
**So that I can quickly identify and diagnose issues without manual inspection and understand the state of the design at a glance.**

#### Description
Currently, generating and viewing waveform diagrams from VCD files requires manual steps, including running specific scripts and potentially dealing with display server configurations in headless environments. This process is cumbersome and prone to errors, as demonstrated by recent attempts to integrate GTKWave rendering in a Dockerized environment.

This feature aims to automate the generation, display, and initial analysis of visual outputs from the FPGA simulation and synthesis workflows. It should provide a streamlined mechanism to:

1.  **Generate Visual Artifacts:** Automatically produce relevant visual outputs (e.g., waveform images from VCD files, potentially other diagrams like block schematics or timing reports).
2.  **Centralized Access/Display:** Offer an easy way to access or view these generated artifacts, ideally integrated into a CI/CD pipeline or a local development environment with minimal setup.
3.  **Highlight Issues:** Automatically highlight or flag potential issues directly on the visual output or provide clear indicators when anomalies are detected (e.g., unexpected signal values, timing violations).

#### Acceptance Criteria
*   **WHEN** the simulation workflow completes **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see automatically generated waveform images from VCD files.
*   **WHEN** visual outputs are generated **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** be able to easily access them from a known location or artifact repository.
*   **WHEN** the system runs in a Docker container **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** observe headless visual output generation without manual display configuration.
*   **WHEN** anomalies or failures are detected in the waveform **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see visual indications or reports highlighting these issues.
*   **WHEN** the system attempts headless rendering **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** not encounter issues related to `xvfb-run --auto-display` or VCD file not found errors.

#### Issues to Address (from previous attempts):
*   `xvfb-run --auto-display` not recognized in the Docker environment.
*   VCD file not being generated in the expected location for the rendering script.
*   General fragility of the headless rendering setup.

#### Success Metrics
*   **Primary Metric:** 100% automated generation of waveform images for all simulated designs within the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   Reduction in manual debugging time for waveform analysis by 20%.
    *   Successful headless rendering rate of 95% or higher in Dockerized environments.
