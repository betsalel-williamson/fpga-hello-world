# User Story: Automated Visual Workflow Output Examination and Comprehensive Test Reporting

## User Persona Definition

- **Name:** FPGA Developer
- **Description:** An FPGA developer is a software engineer specializing in FPGA development. This role is responsible for designing, simulating, and verifying Verilog code. The developer needs efficient ways to quickly assess the correctness of designs, especially when working in automated CI/CD environments where visual inspection is not always feasible.

**As an FPGA Developer,**
**I want to easily examine visual outputs (like waveform diagrams) and comprehensive test reports from the FPGA workflow in an automated fashion,**
**So that I can quickly identify and diagnose issues without manual inspection, understand the state of the design at a glance, and track test quality metrics.**

## Description

Currently, assessing visual outputs and test reports from FPGA simulations involves manual and often complex steps, particularly in automated environments. This leads to delays and potential errors in identifying design issues.

This feature aims to automate the generation, display, and initial analysis of visual outputs from the FPGA simulation and synthesis workflows, alongside comprehensive test reporting. It should provide a streamlined mechanism to:

1. **Generate Visual Artifacts:** Automatically produce relevant visual outputs (e.g., waveform images, other diagrams) for all three HDL toolchains (Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL).
2. **Generate Comprehensive Test Reports:** Automatically generate JUnit-style test reports and code coverage reports for all three HDL toolchains.
3. **Centralized Access/Display:** Offer an easy way to access or view these generated artifacts and reports, ideally integrated into a CI/CD pipeline or a local development environment with minimal setup.
4. **Highlight Issues:** Automatically highlight or flag potential issues directly on the visual output or provide clear indicators when anomalies are detected (e.g., unexpected signal values, timing violations).

## Acceptance Criteria

- **WHEN** the simulation workflow completes for any HDL (Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL) **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see automatically generated waveform images, highlighting key moments (signals, time duration).
- **WHEN** the simulation workflow completes for any HDL (Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL) **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see automatically generated JUnit-style test reports.
- **WHEN** the simulation workflow completes for any HDL (Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL) **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see automatically generated test code coverage reports.
- **WHEN** visual outputs and test reports are generated **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** be able to easily access them from a known location or artifact repository.
- **WHEN** the system runs in a Docker container **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** observe headless visual output generation and report generation without manual display configuration.
- **WHEN** anomalies or failures are detected in the waveform or test reports **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** see visual indications or reports highlighting these issues.
- **WHEN** the system attempts headless rendering **THEN** the FPGA Developer **SHALL** not encounter issues related to display configuration or file access.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric:** 100% automated generation of waveform images, JUnit reports, and code coverage reports for all simulated designs within the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - Reduction in manual debugging time for waveform analysis and test result interpretation by 20%.
  - Successful headless rendering and report generation rate of 95% or higher in Dockerized environments.
