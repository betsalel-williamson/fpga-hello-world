# User Story: FPGA Hello World GitHub CI Build

## User Persona

**Name:** FPGA Developer
**Description:** A software or hardware developer who is setting up the foundational development environment and CI pipeline for FPGA projects. They are focused on local development, build automation, and ensuring the correctness of the FPGA design through simulation.

- **As an** FPGA Developer
- **I want to** successfully build and simulate a basic "Hello World" FPGA design within a GitHub CI environment
- **so that** I can establish a robust and reproducible local development and automated build process for FPGA designs, ensuring design correctness before cloud deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN I develop the "Hello World" FPGA design locally THEN I SHALL be able to simulate it successfully.
- WHEN I push changes to the FPGA design to GitHub THEN the CI pipeline SHALL automatically build the FPGA design and run simulations.
- WHEN the CI pipeline runs simulations THEN I SHALL see a clear indication of successful simulation and verification of output.
- WHEN the CI pipeline completes THEN the generated simulation artifacts (e.g., VCD files) SHALL be available.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: Successful and reproducible build and simulation of the "Hello World" FPGA design within the GitHub CI environment.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
    - Availability of simulation artifacts (e.g., VCD files) from CI runs.
    - Consistency of simulation results across local and CI environments.
