# User Story: SystemVerilog Hello World Example

## User Persona Definition

- **Name:** FPGA Developer
- **Description:** An FPGA developer who is familiar with Verilog and is looking to explore SystemVerilog for new projects. They need clear, simple examples to understand the basic syntax and workflow for SystemVerilog development, including simulation and verification.

## User Story Format

- **As an** FPGA Developer
- **I want to** have a basic "Hello World" example implemented in SystemVerilog
- **so that** I can quickly understand the fundamental structure and simulation process for SystemVerilog designs.

## Acceptance Criteria Requirements

- WHEN I compile and simulate the SystemVerilog "Hello World" example THEN I SHALL see "Hello, SystemVerilog!" printed to the console.
- WHEN I run the verification script THEN I SHALL receive a success message indicating the simulation output was as expected.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: Successful compilation, simulation, and verification of the SystemVerilog example.
- **Secondary Metrics**: Ease of understanding the SystemVerilog code and the associated build/simulation scripts.
